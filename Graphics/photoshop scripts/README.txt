These scripts is for standard events (not news events).

WIDE:
It assumes the source file is a photo (or similar picture), that is wider than it is tall. (at least a ratio of 5:4)
If that is the case, and the focus of the picture is in the middle, no further preparations are required before running the script.

The script only crops the left and right side of the source file - it does not crop height. Tall pictures might result in white borders - and should therefore be appropriately cropped in advance, or be done with the tall script.
Any errors that the script reports can be ignored. If any questions remain, ask ~mw~.

TALL:
It assumes the source file is a poster, or a portrait (or similar picture), that is taller than it is wide. (less than a ratio of 5:4)
It doesn't crop the picture, only resizes it. Other than that, nothing is different from the first script.
